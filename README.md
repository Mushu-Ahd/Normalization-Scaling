# Normalization-Scaling

In simple words, this is a technique which eliminates the unit of the dataset and lets only magnitude which further is useful for ML algorithm to understand.
There are several types of Normalization, some are as follows:-
1. MinMaxScaler is the most used (90% of the time) in Machine Learning 
2. Mean Normalization
3. Max absolute Scaler
4. Robust scaling
